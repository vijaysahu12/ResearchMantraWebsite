        <div class="legal-content">
            <p>This Refund Policy governs the refund terms for all advisory services (“Services”) provided by Research
                Mantra. By purchasing or subscribing to our Services, you agree to the terms below.</p>

            <h2>1. Advance Fees</h2>
            <p>All fees for advisory Services are payable in advance. Fees collected in advance will cover a maximum
                period of one quarter (three months) of Services.</p>

            <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
            <p>A refund is available only if Services are terminated early—by you or by us—before the end of the prepaid
                period. No other refunds, including requests based on market performance or client dissatisfaction, will
                be granted.</p>

            <h2>3. Suspension or Cancellation of Registration</h2>
            <p>If our registration as a SEBI-registered Research Analyst is suspended for more than 60 days or is
                cancelled, you will be entitled to a pro-rata refund for the remaining unexpired portion of the prepaid
                period, less any applicable taxes and statutorily mandated charges.</p>

            <h2>4. Processing Refunds</h2>
            <p>Refunds will be processed within 30 days of receiving a valid termination notice or upon effective
                suspension/cancellation date. Refunds will be credited via the original payment method unless otherwise
                agreed in writing.</p>

            <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
            <p>To request a refund, please submit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A written termination notice (email accepted)</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may amend this Refund Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on our website with an
                updated “Last Updated” date. Continued use of Services after changes constitute your acceptance.</p>
